        <h3>I see the chocolate on the plate in front of me</h3>
        <p>Light from the chocolate enters my <a data-part='sight'>eyes</a>.</p>
        <p> The light from the chocoalte signal finds its way from the eyes to the  <a data-part='cuneus'>cuneus</a> at the back of the brain.</p>
        <p>The diagram below illustrates how light gets transformed into nerve signals in the retina, enters the optic nerve, mixes signals from the left and right eyes in the optic chiasm, gets relayed by LGNs to the Cuneus.</p>

        <p>Pleasant memories from the <a data-part='hippocampus'>hippocampus</a> send a trigger to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), to release dopamine. This spreads the news in the brain that this is something good.</p>
