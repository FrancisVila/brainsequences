Editing sequences works, but glitches remain:
* When I edit a sequence, then click Cancel, the draft sequence remains. It should be deleted, after asking the user whether he or she is sure
* I created a new sequence, and when I edit it I see "No steps in this sequence" (this is normal), but I don't see the Add Sequence button
* In the list of sequences I see the same sequence twice, once with Draft and once without. When this is the case, remove the card without Draft.
