Create a route for viewing a sequence. The url of the route is <server>/sequences/<id>. The filename is sequence.tsx, located in the routes/ folder, the name of the component is Sequence.
The title of the sequence is followed by a down chevron. When the user clicks on the title of the sequence, the page displays a list of links to the available sequences, beneath the title.
The component lists the steps in the selected sequence. Each sequence shows its title. One step at a time is selected. The user can click on a step to select it. The selected step shows its description, unselected steps do not. The selected step also shows the list of brainparts associated to it.
Above the list of steps, reserve space for a graphic representation of the step, which will be created later. For the moment, in that area, indicate the title of the selected step.
