Add a new route called sequences
This route should be the default page for the app https://brainsequences.vercel.app
It should contain a list of published sequences, listed in the form of cards
Each card contains the text of the title of the sequence
If the user is logged on and has edited some sequences, divide the page into 2 sections:
"My sequences" contains sequences that are either published or not, that I have created or worked on. If the sequence is not published, mark it as "Draft"
"Other sequences" contains all published sequences except those in My sequences
