In sequence.tsx, add a multiselect toggle below the HighlightedImage.tsx component, to select between view 'sketch', 'bitmap', or 'all' 

I'd rather have a radio-button toggle

apply tim_taylor_all.css only if the view is 'all'

If view is 'all' do not apply tim_taylor.css

tim_taylor fails to load in 'sketch' and 'bitmap' views

tim_taylor.css still fails to load in 'sketch' and 'bitmap' views
